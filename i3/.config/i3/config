        # The available classes are:

            # client.focused_inactive: The most recently focused view within a container which is not focused.
            # client.placeholder: Ignored (present for i3 compatibility).
            # client.unfocused: A view that does not have focus.
            # client.urgent: A view with an urgency hint. Note: Native Wayland windows do not support urgency. Urgency only works for Xwayland windows.
        #The meaning of each color is:
            # border: The border around the title bar.
            # background: The background of the title bar.
            # text: The text color of the title bar.
            # indicator: The color used to indicate where a new view will open. In a tiled container, this would paint the right border of the current view if a new view would be opened to the right.
            # child_border: The border around the view itself.
